Hi!! Are you an avid techie person, who wants to learn Flutter(Dart) for App Development. Then this app is for you. This is a portfolio app created using flutter.

Just don't worry. I have given detailed comments for each and every step of our code, so that you can understand it better. All the best and Good Luck with the app.

So, without any further delay, lets jump into our app and look how our app has taken good shape.
